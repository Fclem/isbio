    <h3> DSRT Data Use in Independent Research </h3>
</div>
<div class="modal-body">
    <h4> Use Conditions </h4>
    <p style="text-align:justify">Data analyzed and stored in breeze database is available under a tiered system, designed to prevent any unauthorized publication, presentation, distribution and use of information without permission from the project managers. This process allows FIMM HTB to monitor data quality within legal framework.  While Breeze frame-work is designed to promote data and code sharing with limited restrictions, we accommodate protected data provided under restricted conditions disclosed by the project managers. The tiers include: </p>
    <ol>
        <li> <b>  Open access conditions:</b> <br>
            This includes data that can be freely used by every registered Breeze user.
        </li>
        <li><b>Controlled Use Conditions requiring project managerâ€™ approval:</b><br>
            <p style="text-align:justify">This includes data requiring efforts to maintain the confidentiality of the information extracted from these data and prevent any unauthorized publication, presentation, distribution and use of information without permission from the project managers. The project manager will monitor all projects utilizing these data and will be informed about findings generated from his/her cohort of data.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p style="text-align:justify"> Controlled data is often governed by regulations in Material Transfer Agreement signed by the project manager and the original supplier of compounds or cells screened. </p>
    <h4>Data Use Conditions</h4>
    <p style="text-align:justify">Breeze development team strives to provide a robust system that supports data contribution and use through a tiered system that distinguishes Open or Controlled access. We require that data contribution and use in Breeze follows these conditions below:</p>
    <ol class="d">
        <li style="text-align:justify">     Identify and annotate all project samples to a common group and attach the restriction constraint if the data cannot be used under Open access tier.</li>

        <li style="text-align:justify">     DSRT data owners should allow researchers at FIMM to access all the data for comparison purposes under agreed terms and conditions.</li>

        <li style="text-align:justify">      Any unclaimed data in breeze will be placed under a common use agreement.</li>

        <li style="text-align:justify">     Controlled use data should only be access, published, and added to presentations when the project manager has accepted the material to be disclosed. In all cases confidentiality of Controlled[AL6]  use data should be adhered to.</li>

        <li style="text-align:justify">    In principle the data generator retains the right to be the first to publish results from controlled use data.</li>

        <li style="text-align:justify">       Data sets with components involving Material Transfer Agreements (MTA) should be treated with maximum care due to legal issues presented in the MTA.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Positive outcomes from data sharing</h4>
    <ol class="d">
        <li>     Data mining in new ways will improve our understanding of DSRT results. </li>

        <li style="text-align:justify">     FIMM HTB unit will be able to monitor quality of data produced periodically and will be able to act if some compounds become degraded over time.</li>

        <li style="text-align:justify">      Duplicated DSRT screening will reduce since data will be openly available to answer some research questions without carrying out extra experiments to prove a hypothesis.</li>

        <li>     Two heads are better than one.</li>

        <li>     Data integration of DSRT data will improve.</li>

        <li>       Teaming together on projects will make research quicker and efficient.</li>

        <li>     Innovation will increase.</li>

        <li>    DSRT Informatics will become more effective when data resides in one place.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Issues that could arise from data sharing</h4>
    <ol class="d">
       <li style="text-align:justify">    Savvy researchers spending less time in the lab could scoop project ideas for students.</li>

        <li style="text-align:justify">    The fear that someone will take your project creates a very competitive environment.</li>

        <li style="text-align:justify">     People will be discouraged to do lab work since data will be available for analysis.</li>
    </ol>
